                    <p>Cowboy Coder</p>
                    <p>Hey im not a coding sensai but I am a cowboy
                        & a geek I know its a weird combo but I 
                        hope we all have fun in this cohort.
                        I live in Florida by Tampa but I am moving to Washington
                        where im building a ranch on 10 plus acres. So I started 
                        looking for careers I could do completely remotely.
                        After getting into reale estate which has had less then desirable
                        results I decided to get my adjuster license renewed only to be hit
                        with rejection for a year I decided if I was going to get back in 
                        I would have to finish my bachelors & after doing a actually useful
                        college major guide it turned out that most companies will hire your   
                        if you have a CS, Engineering, or Business degree, thats when my brother 
                        inlaw who has been a software developer for many years said I should get into it,
                        it fits my skill sets, it is remote & pays really well. he is currently making 300k a year,
                        & I could have a company im working for bankroll my bachelors while I work.
                        So I started with the odin project a free coding school & I got stuck not knowing what I was
                        doing & I had no one to talk to about it, so that led me to bootcamps
                        & after heavy vetting of multiple bootcamps, I settled on Coding Temple as it was the best
                        value with the reviews. Hobbies I work with horses, both farm & predator animals. I also I write
                        & do alot of crafting. </p>
